Until recently, the eSports Manager website was extremely simple. It was just a static HTML page that did its job: present the project and give a general idea of what it was about. The problem was that it didn't really grow with the project. Updating it meant editing files by hand, and there was no proper way to write posts, share progress, or talk about changes in a structured way.

For a while, I've been wanting to share the progress of the project. I had been doing that using the [GitHub's discussions](https://github.com/esports-manager/esports-manager/discussions), but that is a bit hidden in the entire project. I wanted us to have an exclusive space to share updates, something like a real blog. However I did not want to migrate everything into WordPress, and I did not want to use ready-made templates from systems like Pelican, Jekyll, or Hugo.

I started searching and stumbled upon [**Astro**](https://astro.build/), which was exactly what I was looking for. I managed to port everything to Astro, preserving the original identity, while adding things that made my life way easier. You can check the code for this website in the public [**repository**](https://github.com/esports-manager/esports-manager.github.io).

## New website features

With the new website, the biggest change is the addition of a proper [**blog section**](/blog.html), which finally gives me a place to write devlogs, share technical decisions, and talk about the ups and downs of development without forcing everything into a single static page.

We also now have an easier way to update the [**project roadmap**](/roadmap.html), no longer relying on manually editing HTML files to keep it up to date. That makes it clearer not only for me, but for anyone following the project, to see where things are heading.

I also reworked the FAQ section into a separate page, and added a **Last updates** section to the homepage, which shows the latest blog posts.

Overall, this gives me a much better and more streamlined way to communicate with people that are interested in the project. I can post updates more frequently, keep the roadmap in sync with reality, and share more of the progress of the current project.

I'm very excited to finally be able to have this space, and I'll probably be doing the same for [**Openfoot Manager**](https://openfootmanager.com) in the next few days as well. 2026 will be a great year for this project, and I hope to finally be able to share a playable build soon with you all!

Thank you for your support, and I'll see you in the next update!
