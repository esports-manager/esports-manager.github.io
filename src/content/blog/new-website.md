Until recently, the eSports Manager website was extremely simple. It was just a static HTML page that did its job: present the project and give a general idea of what it was about. The problem was that it didn’t really grow with the project. Updating it meant editing files by hand, and there was no proper way to write posts, share progress, or talk about changes in a structured way.

As the project evolved, that started to feel limiting.

With the new website, built using [**Astro**](https://astro.build/), I kept the same visual identity and overall feel, but redesigned the structure to be more flexible. The biggest change is the addition of a proper **blog section**, which finally gives me a place to write devlogs, share technical decisions, and talk about the ups and downs of development without forcing everything into a single static page.

I also reworked how the **project roadmap** is presented. Instead of being a static snapshot that quickly becomes outdated, it’s now much easier to update and reflect the current state of development. That makes it clearer not only for me, but for anyone following the project, to see where things are heading.

Overall, this gives me a much better and more streamlined way to communicate. I can post updates more frequently, keep the roadmap in sync with reality, and share progress as it happens.

It’s a small change on the surface, but it makes a big difference for the long-term health of the project.
