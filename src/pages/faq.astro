                    <b>eSports Manager</b> is a game where you can manage an eSports
                    team, just like you can do in games such as
                    <b>Football Manager</b>, <b>FIFA Manager</b>,
                    <b>Championship Manager</b>, <b>Elifoot</b>, and etc.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    This project was inspired by a game called
                    <b
                      ><a href="https://bygfoot.sourceforge.io/new/">Bygfoot</a
                      ></b
                    >, which is sort of a free and open source alternative to
                    Football Manager. Bygfoot is written in C and the interface
                    is written in GTK 2. It's pretty outdated for today's
                    standards, and the original developers no longer maintain
                    the project, with a few players still active on it.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    I wanted to develop a game using the technologies I was most
                    comfortable with, so I wrote the base of the game in Python
                    back in 2020 as a hobby project. Initially, I didn't know
                    what I was doing, so the game went through several rewrites,
                    and eventually, it became what I'm working right now. Just
                    recently I got more comfortable to invest more time into
                    this project and try to bring it to life just as I
                    envisioned it.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Right now the game is still in development, and I'm using a
                    mix of web technologies to build its UI.

                    My idea with this game was to build a simple simulation
                    engine, similar to what Football Manager and Championship
                    Manager did on their early days. You can see the
                    descriptions of what happens in the matches, but no visual
                    representation.

                    3D is very hard to pull off for a single developer. Maybe
                    it's something we can work on in the future.

                    My initial idea for this game was to develop a League of
                    Legends manager game. Back in 2018, when the idea came to my
                    mind, Riot Games would allow people to make fan projects
                    using their IP and stuff, so I was sort of trying to work
                    out on my own LoL manager project.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    In late 2019, Riot Games announced they would be working
                    their own LoL eSports Manager project, and they changed
                    their
                    <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/legal"
                      ><b>Legal Jibber Jabber</b></a
                    >
                    page to prohibit fan games. It's already 2024, and I haven't seen
                    the release of the LoL eSports Manager. I believe it was only
                    released as a gacha game in China, which is such a

                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    So, instead, on eSports Manager you will be able to play a
                    MOBA game inspired by League of Legends.

                  <p>
                    In the future I plan to include RTS (inspired by Starcraft
                    2) and FPS (inspired by CounterStrike).

                    Unfortunately, I don't have a release date yet. I have a
                    full-time job, and I work on this during my spare time or
                    whenever I feel like it. I also have many projects that I'm
                    working on at the same time, so my attention is not entirely
                    focused here. As a sister project, I also have
                    <a href="https://github.com/openfootmanager/openfootmanager"
                      ><b>Openfoot Manager</b></a
                    >, which is my version of Football Manager, which is also
                    free and open source.

                  <p>
                    If you want the project to release earlier, you can submit
                    your own contributions. Just check out how you can
                    contribute
